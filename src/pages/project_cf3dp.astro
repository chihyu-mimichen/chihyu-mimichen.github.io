	  In this project, I developed a multi-functional printhead integrated onto an
	  industrial robotic arm. The printhead is capable of switching between thermoplastic extrusion, 
	  heated compaction roller, and continuous carbon fiber 3D printing. The robotic integration
	  allows non-planar printing and the fabrication of geometrically complex composite structures. 
	  The photos below show the full functional setup of the system.

	<p>
	  The motivation for this work is that manufacturers of small and complex
	  composite components still primarily rely on manual hand layup processes.
	  These approaches are labor-intensive, require skilled technicians,
	  expensive tooling, and long production times, which significantly increase
	  manufacturing cost and limit scalability. Several companies have attempted to 
	  automate the production of small composite parts using composite 3D printing, 
	  including Markforged, Anisoprint, and 9TLabs.
	  However, the achieved material properties often do not meet industrial
	  requirements due to low fiber volume content and high void content.
	  These limitations lead to poor interlaminar bonding and reduced mechanical
	  performance.

	  These limitations motivated the development of a robotic continuous fiber
	  additive manufacturing system with improved material quality and process
	  control. The system was designed to increase fiber volume content, reduce void
	  formation, and enable precise fiber placement and compaction.
