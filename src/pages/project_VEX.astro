       I participated in the VEX Robotics Competition in 2013 as part of Team 4744,
	   where I was involved in the design, development, and testing of competition
	   robots for the annual challenge “Sack Attack.” The competition required teams
	   to design and build autonomous and driver-controlled robots capable of
	   completing a series of scoring tasks within a dynamic match environment.
      </br></br>
      Below is an illustration depicting the competition's battlefield. The competition format involved two alliances, 
	  each consisting of two teams, competing to transport game objects from their initial locations to various 
	  scoring zones. Points were awarded based on task completion and the robot’s final position at the end of each match.

      Our two robots, 4744A and 4744B, achieved strong results at the VEX regional competition in Tokyo, Japan. 
	  Robot 4744B won the tournament and performed successfully in the skills challenge, and robot 4744A received the Design Award. 
	  These results qualified our team for the VEX World Championship in California, USA, later that year.
