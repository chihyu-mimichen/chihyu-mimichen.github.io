    <p>
      Exoskeletons, or wearable robots, have gained popularity in recent years due to the rising awareness 
      for people suffering from paraplegia and the growing demand for rehabilitative devices. In November 2021, I co-founded the 
      DASH exoskeleton student team at the Technical University of Munich with the objective of developing a lower-limb 
      exoskeleton to assist fully paraplegic individuals in standing up and walking again, extending their ability 
      to participate socially.

  <div class="w-full" style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: justify;">
    <p>
      For the first prototype, we designed a drive test setup to assess the functionality of our self-developed 
      cycloidal drives, motors, and initial control algorithms. We have also created a preliminary prototype of the exoskeleton using additive manufacturing 
      methods to ensure the proper assembly of all parts. We aimed to refine this prototype by improving the actuation system by using a linear actuator, metallizing 
      the prototype, and build a full Digital Twin of the exoskeleton. Below is a concept video of our first prototype.

  <div class="w-full" style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: justify;">
    <p>
      Our project has reached a significant milestone with the design and development of a fully functional metal exoskeleton prototype, as shown in the images below. The current prototype weighs approximately 30 kg, primarily constructed from metal.

Our next step is to explore carbon composites to redesign the exoskeleton for weight reduction, enhancing both performance and usability. Additionally, we aim to integrate computer vision to enable the exoskeleton to perceive its surroundings, learn from the environment, and make intelligent control decisions.
