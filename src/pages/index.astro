	  <p>
		I am a mechanical and R&D engineer and a research associate at the 
		Chair of Carbon Composites at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), 
		currently in the final phase of my doctoral research. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<br />
	  </p>
	  <p>
		During my PhD, I developed advanced manufacturing processes for continuous fiber 
		non-planar additive manufacturing using industrial robots.
		I have gained extensive hands-on experience in carbon 
		composite materials, mechanical design, product development, and industrial
		robotic systems, with applications in both the medical 
		and aerospace domains. Additionally, I am a co-founder of DASH, a student team at TUM dedicated 
		to developing lower-limb exoskeletons for paraplegic patients, where I contributed 
		to system design, prototyping, and project coordination.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<br />
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I am currently seeking new professional opportunities in R&D, product development, 
		or advanced manufacturing in the fields of robotics, medical technology, and 
		aerospace applications.
