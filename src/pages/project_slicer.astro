    <p>
      Fused filament fabrication (FFF), a type of extrusion-based additive manufacturing method, has proven its suitability for 
      the production of highly complex components without costly tooling. However, traditional FFF systems are restricted to planar 
      layer deposition, which results in poor surface smoothness and a reduction in strength and stiffness along the layer-stacking 
      direction. Recent advancements in the FFF process have made it possible to reinforce and strengthen the printed parts with continuous 
      fibers, which significantly increases the material's anisotropy. Therefore, non-planar printing is necessary to optimize the anisotropic 
      material behavior. 
      
      </br></br>
      We developed a non-planar slicing method for optimizing the performance of continuous fiber-reinforced FFF parts 
      printed using a 6-DOF industrial robot. The computational framework allows for the deposition of material on non-planar surfaces along the 
      direction of the largest principal stress obtained from a finite element analysis following topology optimization.
      The non-planar slicer consists of several stages, shown in the flowchart below,
      which convert the input dataset into machine commands that can be sent to both the robot controller (KUKA KR4) 
      and the custom extruder programmable logic controller (PLC).

    Several functions, such as layer height, line width of plastic and composite extruder, fiber volume content (FVC), 
    and degree of curvature of print layers, are integrated into the non-planar slicer. Users are able to adjust the 
    parameters according to their preferences. Figure below shows one of the sliced layers of the torque link with different FVC. 
    Blue, green, and red lines indicate the printing paths of the plastic nozzle, composite nozzle, and the support structure, respectively.
