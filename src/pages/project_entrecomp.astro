  <div class="w-full" style="margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;">
    <p>
      People with disabilities face significant challenges navigating cities due to lack of real-time, reliable accessibility information and unforeseen obstacles in infrastructure.
	  </br></br>
	  UrbanAccess is an innovative mobile navigation app designed for people with disabilities. It provides real-time, reliable, and personalized accessibility information for urban environments. Using crowdsourced data, AI-powered mapping, and augmented reality (AR), the app enables users to plan accessible routes, receive live updates on obstacles, and rate public facilities based on inclusivity. Advanced machine learning techniques are used for pavement distress identification, stair detection, and obstacle recognition, ensuring precise and up-to-date accessibility insights. Additionally, the augmented reality feature enhances accessibility by providing audio cues, haptic feedback, and visual contrast adjustments, helping partially sighted users navigate urban environments more effectively. Beyond improving mobility and independence for individuals, UrbanAccess also provides valuable data-driven insights for city planners and businesses to create more inclusive spaces.

  <div class="w-full" style="margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;">
    <p>
      Current math education relies heavily on language, making it inaccessible to children who do not understand the language of instruction. This issue affects underserved communities, leaving children struggling with both linguistic and mathematical barriers and widening global education inequalities.
	  </br></br>
	  M Cubed (M³) addresses this challenge with an AI-powered, language-free math learning platform that teaches foundational and advanced math concepts using visual, culturally neutral content. Unlike traditional methods, M Cubed eliminates the need for text-based explanations, ensuring that children, regardless of their language background, can develop problem-solving skills and mathematical proficiency. The platform features AI-driven personalized learning, gamified interactive exercises, and offline functionality, making it accessible even in low-connectivity regions. By removing language as a barrier, M Cubed empowers children worldwide with equal opportunities to learn and succeed in mathematics.
